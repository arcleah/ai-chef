# Chef AI
What is Chef AI?
Chef AI was created in hopes of minimizing food waste, where we are your own personal fridge AND personal chef, creating recipes that strive to utilize as much of your ingredients into a hearty, yummy meal!
SAY NO TO FOOD WASTE!

> ‚ÄúThe fight against food waste begins in the home.‚Äù ‚Äì Paul Polman.

This perspective aligns perfectly with our belief in the power of individual actions to drive collective change. By integrating technology into our daily routines, we have a tremendous opportunity to promote sustainability right from our kitchens.

## üå± What is our Inspiration for an App like this?
We love the finer things in life, much like delicious food. In spite of that, food waste is a critical factor in climate change, significantly contributing to greenhouse gas emissions that affect our ecosystem. With that in mind, with our profound love for food and an unwavering commitment to addressing global issues, we've crafted a project that aligns with both our passions and the planet's needs.

## ü•¶ What it Does
Our project is a website that which users can create profiles and interact with their virtual pantries where they can input the particular foods/produce that they have in their household. The website will help visually show the user how soon their produce will expire and be able to communicate with ChatGPT for applicable recipes to the food that will expire the soonest and reduce the amount of possible food we have to throw without even realizing it.

## üåø How we built it

Our application's backend is mainly built using **Flask**, **Python** while our database stores user and pantry information using **SQLite**. Our front-end was built mainly using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. We also made use of **OpenAI's API** to handle our AI-generated recipes.

## üåµ Challenges we ran into

We faced many challenges during the process of our project, but the two problems we believe we had the most trouble with were the following:

- A challenge we ran into while making our project was limited by our experience and created issues for us, especially for time management as we spent a lot of time doing the necessary research we needed to do in the making of our website.
- Another challenge we faced while connecting the front and back-end code was the usual formatting issues, buttons not reacting the way they should, however our biggest challenge was connecting the API to our application. Figuring out the correct syntax and implementation methods was especially troublesome as we are new to these technologies.

## üçÄ Accomplishments that we‚Äôre proud of 

We are really happy with our UI design and our detailed planning that allowed us to smoothly integrate and solve problems as they arose.

We are also really proud of the amount of languages and implementations we learned on the way, we engaged and loved the experience during the making of this application that required us to work quickly and be on our toes!

## üíö What We Learned

Similar to our accomplishments, we learned and applied new languages such as HTML, Flask, and generally most of the back-end development.

We learned that teamwork and time management plays a crucial role in the effectiveness of our work and most importantly the amount of work a team can do in 24 hours!

## üå≥ What‚Äôs next for Chef AI

A better integration of the uniqueness of every individual that allows users to be more specific about their dietary restrictions and allergies. We would love to in the future attempt to bring our website to mobile devices that allows kitchen management on the go.
*Note that this project was done for Code to Change YYC 2023 and is subject to more improvement in the future!
