# Chef AI
What is Chef AI?
Chef AI was created in hopes of minimizing food waste, where we are your own personal fridge AND personal chef, creating recipes that strive to utilize as much of your ingredients into a hearty, yummy meal!
SAY NO TO FOOD WASTE!

What is our Inspiration for an App like this?
We love the finer things in life, much like delicious food. In spite of that, food waste is a critical factor in climate change, significantly contributing to greenhouse gas emissions that affect our ecosystem. With that in mind, with our profound love for food and an unwavering commitment to addressing global issues, we've crafted a project that aligns with both our passions and the planet's needs.

How does it Work?
Our project is a website that which users can create profiles and interact with their virtual pantries where they can input the particular foods/produce that they have in their household. The website will help visually show the user how soon their produce will expire and be able to communicate with ChatGPT for applicable recipes to the food that will expire the soonest and reduce the amount of possible food we have to throw without even realizing it.

What's next?
Better integration of the uniqueness of every individual allows users to be more specific about their dietary restrictions and allergies. We would love to in the future attempt to bring our website to mobile devices that allows kitchen management on the go.

*Note that this project was done for Code to Change YYC 2023 and is subject to more improvement in the future!
